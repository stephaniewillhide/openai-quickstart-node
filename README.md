# Friendly Invite Generator

This uses the OpenAI API to allow users to plug in some basic information and receive a polite and friendly prompt they can send to a friend to make plans. It uses the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework with [React](https://reactjs.org/). Check out the tutorial or follow the instructions below to get set up.
